﻿﻿﻿# 0. OverviewAll of the Kabuki Toolkit project files are broken at the moment because I deleted all the CMake files like an idiot.## I. Table of Content0. Overview    i. Table of Content1. Setup2. Development    i. Plugin Development Process# 1. SetupRight now the Visual Studio projects are mapped to "C:\Workspace" at the moment. Please feel free to remap the include and library directories to relative paths. It's a todo.## Step 1Download and install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) with all of the C++ tools, and create folder "C:\Workspace".## Step 2```cd d:\workspacegit clone https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.git```## Step 2BYou might need to recompile CppUTest if your compiler complains. Open up the solution file in the cpputest root director and build it or run the make file.## Step 3```git clone https://github.com/google/angle.git```## Step 4Add the "C:/Workspace/cpputest/include", and "C:/Workspace/angle/include" to your project's "Additional include directories" and add "C:/cpputest/lib/cpputest.lib" and "Winmm.lib" to the linker Additional Dependencies.## Step 5(Optional) Copy "~/source/kabuki/chinese_room/include/assembly.h" into your source code root for your project and modify the assembly settings to suit your needs using the instructions in the file.## Step 6Download CMake Executables (Building CMake is outside of the scope of this Guide) and add CC:\Program Files\CMake\bin to the Environment Path Variables.## Step 7Once you've gotten your project setup, please check out the [Example projects](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/tree/master/projects).# 2. DevelopmentWhatever questions you have other people no doubt will also have. Please see and modify the [FAQ](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/tree/master/docs/faq).## I. Plugin Development ProcessTo develop plugins with Kabuki Toolkit it is recommended to start out by developing your application as a standalone application that links to a statically compiled version of Kabuki Toolkit. This will dramatically improve compile time as it eliminates a lot of redundant compiling.
