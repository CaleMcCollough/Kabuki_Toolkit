﻿﻿﻿# 0. OverviewAll of the Kabuki Toolkit project files are broken at the moment because I deleted all the CMake files like an idiot.## I. Table of Content0. Overview    i. Table of Content1. Setup2. Development    i. Plugin Development Process# 1. SetupRight now the Visual Studio projects are mapped to "C:\Workspace" at the moment. Please feel free to remap the include and library directories to relative paths. It's a todo.## Step 1Download and install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) with all of the C++ tools, and create folder "C:\Workspace".## Step 2```cd d:\workspacegit clone https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.git```## Step 2BYou will more than likely need to recompile CppUTest, but only if your compiler complains. Open up the solution file in the "C:/Workspace/cpputest" root director and build it or run the make file.## Step 3```git clone https://github.com/google/angle.git```## Step 4(Optional) Copy "~/source/kabuki/chinese_room/include/assembly.h" and "~/source/kabuki/chinese_room/include/this.h" into your source code root for your project and modify the assembly settings to suit your needs using the instructions in the file.## Step 5Download CMake Executables (Building CMake is outside of the scope of this Guide) and add CC:\Program Files\CMake\bin to the Environment Path Variables.## Step 6Open a console in the ~/source/kabuki folder and build the Kabuki Toolkit Library with the command:```cmake ./```## Step 7Create a new C++ Visual Studio project in "C:/Workspace" and add "C:/cpputest/lib/cpputest.lib" and "Winmm.lib" to the Linker Additional Dependencies (@see Google "How to Add Linker Additional Dependencies in Visual Studio").## Final StepOnce you've gotten your project setup check out the [Example projects](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/tree/master/projects) and copy the files you need into your new project and remap the #include files. Also check out the [CMake Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) and [CMake and Visual Studio](https://cognitivewaves.wordpress.com/cmake-and-visual-studio/).# 2. DevelopmentWhat ever questions you have other people no doubt will also have. Please see and modify the [FAQ](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/tree/master/docs/faq).## I. Plugin Development ProcessTo develop plugins with Kabuki Toolkit it is recommended to start out by developing your application as a standalone application that links to a statically compiled version of Kabuki Toolkit. This will dramatically improve compile time as it eliminates a lot of redundant compiling.
