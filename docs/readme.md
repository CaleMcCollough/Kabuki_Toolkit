# Kabuki Toolkit Documentation
Please see "~/docs/kabuki-toolkit_diagrams.mdj" for [StarUML](http://staruml.io) for object models. 
Some of the docs are currently in .docx format. These documents need to be converted into Markdown
format as soon as possible and more code samples added. There is a productivity programming book in
here too which is undergoing some changes at the moment. We're focusing on making money through 
saving time.
