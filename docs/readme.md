# Kabuki Toolkit Documentation
Please see "~/docs/kabuki-toolkit_diagrams.mdj" for [StarUML](http://staruml.io) for object models. Some of the docs are currently in .docx format. These documents need to be converted into Markdown format as soon as possible and more code samples added. There is a productivity programming book in here too which is undergoing some changes at the moment. We're focusing on making money through saving time.

## Organization
Documents are split between the Wiki and the ~/docs folder.  Documents that are specific to Toolkit Versions are placed in the ~/docs folder and documents that are independet of version go in the Wiki.
