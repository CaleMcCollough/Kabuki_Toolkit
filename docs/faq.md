# Kabuki Starship Documentation

The Doxyfile is used to create the [Kabuki Starship API Docs](https://kabuki.github.io/api/). You may build these yourself for offline viewing. The UML diagrams can be found in the "Kabuki Toolkit Diagrams.mdj" file.

# Frequently Asked Questions

---
* Where should I start?
  * The best place to start is with the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/CaleMcCollough/kabuki-script/wiki/02-quickstart-guide).
---
* How do I get started as a developer?
   * The best way to get started as a developer is to go through and clean up the code. This SDK was created from a hodgepodge of various open-source commercial-friendly BSD-style licensed software. There is still a lot of mess to clean up from the integration process. Whatever questions you have other people will no doubt ask as well. Please add these questions to this FAQ and to relevant example projects and API docs.
---
* What is the documentation and documentation process?
  * This SDK uses [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). The project is currently setup using D:\Workpace. API docs get exported to the [Kabuki Theater website].
---
* Why does the website look all messed up?
  * The [Kabuki Toolkit website](https://kabuki.github.io/) needs to get fixed ASAP. The CSS is messed up in full-screen mode, but works right in less than about 1024 pixel widths. It's something about the @media section in the CSS.
---
* What is the style guide?
  * All of the Kabuki Toolkit projects use the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). The style guide helps developers to identify the purpose of the code based on it's formatting. Most of the code is not in this format, so we could really use some helps formatting the style. We need to export a Visual Studio C++ code format file and could use some help with that.
---
* Is there any UML?
  * We're using [StarUML 2.x](http://staruml.io/). The models can be found in the file "~/Documents/Kabuki Starship.mdj". Most of the included modules were not documented correctly and will need to be back annotated. This is a back burner project and is only done when needed. Please feel free to help us write use cases and scenario.
