Add opening and closing curly brackets around all if statements and add debug print statements instead of comments as much as possible to reduce debug time. You may  use the PRINT, PRINT_ERROR, and PRINTF macros or comment out the print statements.2. For integers with strictly non-negative input yet no clear upper bounds, use the second to most significant bit to mark the invalid upper range. This allows both the lower and upper bounds to be checked using a single instruction. For example if using a 32-bit integer the upper bounds is 2^30 - 1 and you can use the following code in C++:```bool CompareValue (int input) {    if ((value >> (sizeof (int) * 8 - 2)) < 0) {        return false;    }    return true;}```3. Avoid using child namespaces lasses shall be named using SubnamespaceBaseclassSubclass format, where Subnamespace is optional, in order to sort objects alphabetically rather than introducing unnecessary hierarchies.
