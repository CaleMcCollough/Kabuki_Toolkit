Each commmit should have a issue and #issue_number (i.e. #420). By clicking on the #issue_number it will take you to the issue where the work should be described with some level of detail.## VisionThe vision of KT is to create consumer electronics, distributed supercomputers games, and touchscreen plugin widgets to interfacing with apps, games, websites, and electronics. The vision of the design of the toolkit is to provide an ultra-fast memory-lean scalable software model from firmware to desktop to server; and that the toolkit be formatted with the Google C++ Style Guide with a toolto change the source code formatting between snake_case, lowerCaseCammel, andUpperCaseCammel.### North Star DirectionThe North Star is the symbolic representation of the project direction intented to keep the project on track. The Nort Star is currently pointed towards:Completing a simple neural network to parse the NMIST data set.## Seam EnumerationThe development is enumberated into major and minor seams that get tested in order from 1_1 through M_m, where M and m are the number of Major and minor seams respectivly. A Minor Seam is defined as a collection of one or more classes, and a Major Seam is defined a s collection of one or more namespaces or C modules. Seams should contain the fewest number of seams as possible, andthe seams should as decoupled as possible.From time to time changes will occur on a seam that may affect the following seam.1.  Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (crabs)2.  serial3.  client4.  hmi and midi5.  tek6.  data7.  id8.  file9.  pro10. math11. store12. al13. g14. gui15. aiml and igeek# Problems with Development.The biggest problem with development has been lack of help.The biggest problem with the toolkit is that there are duplicated SSL libraries. mbed uses PolarSSL and Google uses OpenSSL. mbed is NOT in Google C++ Style Guide, so it will need a script to refactor it or wrap the classes.
