Each commit should have a issue and #issue_number (i.e. #420). By clicking on the #issue_number it will take you to the issue where the work should be described with some level of detail.## VisionThe vision of KT is to create consumer electronics, distributed supercomputers, games, servers, and touchscreen plugin widgets to interfacing with apps, games, websites, and electronics. The vision of the design of the toolkit is to provide an ultra-fast memory-lean scalable software model from firmware to desktop to server; and that the toolkit be formatted with the Google C++ Style Guide with a tool to change the source code formatting between snake_case, lowerCaseCammel, and UpperCaseCammel.### North Star DirectionThe North Star is the symbolic representation of the project direction intended to keep the project on track. The North Star is currently pointed towards:Completing kabuki::tek::Unicontroller and mapping it to the kabuki::toolkit::hmi API.## Third-party DependenciesKT is engineered to not require many third-party dependencies. KT requires the Google C++ API and Google ANGLE.## Seam EnumerationThe development is enumerated into major and minor seams that get tested in order from 1_1 through M_m, where M and m are the number of Major and minor seams respectively. A Minor Seam is defined as a collection of one or more classes, and a Major Seam is defined a s collection of one or more namespaces or C modules. Seams should contain the fewest number of seams as possible, andthe seams should as decoupled as possible. For details about what each seamsis and does, please see the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki-toolkit/projects).## Problems with Development.The biggest problem with development has been lack of help.
