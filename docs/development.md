Add opening and closing curly brackets around all if statements and add debug print statements instead of comments as much as possible to reduce debug time. You may  use the PRINT, PRINT_ERROR, and PRINTF macros or comment out the print statements.2. For integers with strictly non-negative input yet no clear upper bounds, use the second to most significant bit to mark the invalid upper range. This allows both the lower and upper bounds to be checked using a single instruction. For example if using a 32-bit integer the upper bounds is 2^30 - 1 and you can use the following code in C++:```bool CompareValue (int input) {    if ((value >> (sizeof (int) * 8 - 2)) < 0) {        return false;    }    return true;}```3. Avoid using child namespaces lasses shall be named using SubnamespaceBaseclassSubclass format, where Subnamespace is optional, in order to sort objects alphabetically rather than introducing unnecessary hierarchies.4. For functions with input that must be sanatized and an error flag returned, return nil upon success and a const char* error string upon failure for all cases where performance or ROM space is not critical.## Main Projects### Kabuki CasinoDemo app for Kabuki Toolkit has multi-layer client-server-database-sercure layers.* *Status:* Demo almost functioning.### AnyLED LED Light ControllerLED light controller that can control both PWM and addressable RGB/W LEDs.* *Status:* Almost working but not mapped with Script.### FlowerBedA solenoid valve controller for watering plants.* *Status:* Working but not mapped with Script.### Script Visualizer3D tool for visualizing routing with Universal Polar IP Addressing.* *Status:* All it does is display wireframe models using software rendering.### QrFiA driver that allows you to use two webcams and screens to create an internet link that allows you to use your secure cellphone to log into sites to pass SSL/TLS keys to safely brows sites over insecure public wifi or other networks.* *Status*: No work done.* *Needs*: Need to get integrate OpenCV with Sloth. That is a messy process.### SlothA #CodeSloth utility for downloading and formating source code into a common style.* *Status*: No work done.### Spacehip EarthA free distributed social media platform written in C++ and Python that uses email and free web hosting services to privide a mix of a Facebook and Myspace.Software uses Script mapped to a Python based web server.* *Status*: Some work on chat system but no work done on email. I'm looking at             the Astroid Email Client to #CodeSloth #4TheWin.## Pipe Dream ProjectsBelow is a list of projects that would be epic but have now immediate plans.### Kabuki OSScript is isainly cool for creating operating systems with because Script parses naturally into Console apps.### Script Programming LanguageThe Script Progrogramming Lanuage would be used for JavaScript style programming.
