Add opening and closing curly brackets around all if statements and add debug print statements instead of comments as much as possible to reduce debug time. You may  use the PRINT, PRINT_ERROR, and PRINTF macros or comment out the print statements.2. For integers with strictly non-negative input yet no clear upper bounds, use the second to most significant bit to mark the invalid upper range. This allows both the lower and upper bounds to be checked using a single instruction. For example if using a 32-bit integer the upper bounds is 2^30 - 1 and you can use the following code in C++:```bool CompareValue (int input) {    if ((value >> (sizeof (int) * 8 - 2)) < 0) {        return false;    }    return true;}```3. Avoid using child namespaces lasses shall be named using SubnamespaceBaseclassSubclass format, where Subnamespace is optional, in order to sort objects alphabetically rather than introducing unnecessary hierarchies.## Under ConstructionThe following modules are under active construction.## SlothKabuki Slot is a utility for cleaning up source code repositories and keeping them formatted when the original repository changes. The purpose is to download a fresh source repo, strip out all the junk, updates the #include references, and formats the code using AStyle. Each module shall get a Sloth Script that starts from nothing, downloads the repo, creates a copy, and destructively edits the copy. Start with downloading each of the 3rd party APIs in KT and look at their original structure and how it differs from KT. Each module has it's own ```module_name.script``` file that should walk the Sloth through each step in the conversion.## kabuki::hmi and kabuki::tek::Unicontroller WidgetsWe are making kabuki::hmi GUI wrappers to make Touchscreen HMI Widgets. It is quite easy to switch between pages of controls with touchscreen widgets. This could be done by anyone who is moderately good with C++. One specific primary objectives is to improve the rotary knobs and sliders so they are easy to make custom controllers with a custom widget background image.
