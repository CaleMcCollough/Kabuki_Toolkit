# 1. Overview

This document outlines the Kabuki Toolkit (KT) projects. This is a living document that will evolve with the Toolkit.

## i. User Interface

KT is both mouse and touchscreen friendly, and users primarily interact with the software via a system tray icon, context menus, and widgets. All of the menus are customizable and skinnable through an extendable plugin API. Plugin packages will be available for various disciplines such as website development, software development, scientific research, project managers, etc. Users can create their own plugin scripts using Python which allows the software to be adapted to whatever needs the user has.

## ii. Software Platform

The software uses a combination of a desktop system-tray app, mobile app, and cross-browser  extension, and a cross-platform app. Users will download the Chrome/Firefox/etc Extention from the Chrome Web Store. Syncing is done via an OAuth.

# 2. KT Projects

## i. Sticky HTML5 Widgets

Sticky HTML5 Widgets allow users to browse web pages like Pandora or Netflix and minimize them to the system tray and pin ontop of other windows. Users also have the option of browsing sites in a mobile mode so that web apps perform the same way they do on a smartphone or tablet.

## ii. Cloud Sticky Notes

Save sticky notes directly to the cloud so that they can be shared by multiple computers. Import notes directly from paper using a webcam or smartphone. A user can export notes in TXT, PDF, and DOCX.

## iii. TV Widgets

Web app based TV widgets can play YouTube channels or other free TV sources.

## iv. Dictionary and Research Tools

Users can copy text on their computer, and click on the system tray icon to get a definition of the word or search for it on the internet or Wikipedia. Software stores an offline version of Wikipedia and dictionary of user's choice that dynamically updates itself as users search for information. Users can bookmark words for future reference, and sync their bookmarked words to the cloud. Webcam tool allows users to point at a word with their finger, or circle a paragraph, and software will automatically scan the word or paragraph(s), and define words and bring up search options.

## v. Graphing Calculator with Equation Editor

KT has a touchscreen friendly skinnable graphing calculator on steroid based on GNU Octave. The software has the ability to process and graph complex mathematical equations. Users can pin calculator windows on top of other windows, and show and hide it with shortcut keys. Equations can import or export from LaTeX, Octave, MatLAB, or Microsoft Word formats.

## vi. Unicode Copy & Paste Widget

Users can copy and paste Unicode text symbols such as Greek letters using a convent widget for quick insertion into Word documents and web searches.  All of your most commonly used symbols will show up at the top. Users can also input text descriptions of the symbol to bring up symbols likes hearts or music notes.

## vii. Task Timer & Analysis Tools

User can set up tasks that they would like to time and set targets for how long they would like to work on tasks. Since the app is in the system tray, the user can do a better job of tracking how much time they are spending doing tasks and chart the time spent over a long period of time. Tools can be set up to remind users that they need to do things. Users can also automatically log the time they have spent on websites such as Facebook. (Maybe we could make a browser plugin.)
