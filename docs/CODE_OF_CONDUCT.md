### Code of Conduct

There are only four rules to be a part of our development community: Thou shalt not jeopardize the mission, get us in trouble with the law, ruin our public image, or scare off contributors. Below is a list of known ways that you can violate the Code of Conduct (CoC).

1. By using the CoC to try to kick people out of the community just because you don't like them or you're too liberal for now.
2. By making others feel bad by being impatient or disrespectful; it takes years to get good with APIs and find contributors.
3. By splitting up our community to try to make money of your spin-off. If a community splits off naturally, more power to you, but this product is Apache-licensed for you to make closed-source software for without paying a licensing fee, not for you to make a spin-off using our community that hurts everyone. There is just no money in open-source software like aside from getting paid to use it and you'll get a higher quality product if you hold the community together and contribute rather than take.
4. By trying to control all of the design decisions, getting hopping mad when people don't go with your idea, or escalating drama with someone who is being a butt-head.
5. By making stupid rules. Fuck the authoritarians; no more stupid rules. #Peace #ImOut #MicDrop
