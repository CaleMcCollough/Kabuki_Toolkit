# kabuki::al Bindings

This folder will in the future conttain cross-language bindings. All Modules are required to have a C++ wrapper. Library code should be written in Embedded-C++. App code should be written in whatever language and technique saves time and makes an acceptable product and whatever code needs to be shared in the library should be ported to Embedded-C++ as soon as possible.
