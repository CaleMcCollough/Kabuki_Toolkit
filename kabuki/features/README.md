# kabuki.platform

The Kabuki VM Features are based on mbed, an IoT platform similar to Arduino but for ARM, adapted to work on x64 processors. The definition of a kabuki.feature is that it may have some hardware support, such as math and audio DSP. It is the OSAL that then abstracts the hardware away for the kabuki.toolkit.
