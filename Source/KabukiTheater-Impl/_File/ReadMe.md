# Archive Implementation
This folder contains the implementation of the _Archive namespace.

#Development
Currently this folder is empty. We just need to wrap the 7Zip C files in a C++ 
wrapper. We need to take the Poco Archive code in the Archive.cpp file and 
remap the code to the SFML file stream classes.
