# ChineseRoom
A light-weight cross-platform C++11 SDK core suitable for both software and firmware based on the Interprocess Protocol and the Chinese room argument.

## Overview
This project is the SDK core for [Kabuki Theater](https://github.com/Kabuki-Toolkit/Kabuki-Theater) and [Kabuki Tek](https://github.com/Kabuki-Toolkit/Kabuki-Tek). Precomipled C++ libraries cannot contain other pre-compiled libraries, so for this reason this is a header-only library. All source files are organized into a single directory, and all unit tests are placed into the TESTS directory. For UML diagrams please see the ChineseRoom.mdj [StarUML](http://staruml.io/) file.
