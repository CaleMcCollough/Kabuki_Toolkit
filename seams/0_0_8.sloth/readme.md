# seams.0_0_8.sloth

Sloth is a early-stage utility for integrating multiple APIs into a modern C++ SDK with a unified styleguide and . Sloth accomplishes this goal using Sloth Scripts and and a KT widget that facilitates Issue Driven Development. Sloth Scripts start out by downloading a git repository, and performing a series of non-destructure refactoring and formatting operations in stages that allow the code to be verified as passing the unit test.

## Issue Driven Development Optimizer

The Issue Drive Development (IDD) Optimizer consists of:

* Revision Control System (RCS) manager for multiple Git repos.
* Auto-import Mecurial, SVN, or CVS repos to Git.
* Auto-save all repos.
* Clean up commits and auto-merge code with master by merging multiple commits on one issue into one.
* HTML-based 
* Auto-IDD-macro Generator that adds macros to turn off all of the code.

### Issue Driven Development

*Issue Drive Development (IDD)* is a *semi-agile life-cycle optimization technique*, meaning:

* The practice is an Agile practice but does not require the project to be in an agile state to use and can help projects get to an agile state.
* The practice is useful for optimizing all aspects of the products life-cycle.

#### IDD Tools

IDD uses the following web apps:

   *  Revision control system.
   *  Issue tracking system (ITS).
   *  Kanban board.

#### IDD Core Tenants

* To maximize productivity and create institutionalized knowledge using a chat-log in the ITS.
* The master repository is always in a working state with a passing unit test, allowing for non-working code to be segregated from working tested code.
* Workers do not do work without first creating an issue in the ITS and placing the issue on the Doing column of the Kan ban board, with the exception that the worker may search for work to do.
* Workers work on a single issue until it is cleared, meaning working and tested to specification, before pushing the issue to the respository. The montra is do work once and only once.
* Never let the issues get Out of Control by making all issues Tamable:
  * Out of Control Issues (OoCI and pronounced oo-key) are issues that either take longer than an acceptable length of a scrum run to complete, and collections of issues that are so numerous that it is impossible to complete them all. A Tamable Issue (TI) is an issue that is able to be accomplished within the working horizon, meaning the current work the team can foresee. This allows the team to move to into or maintain an agile state beyond the horizon.
