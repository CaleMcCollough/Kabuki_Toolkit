# Kabuki Theater Visual Studio Projects
Do not develop here! To develop Kabuki Theater, we are using Symmetry Station right now. This will change in the future.

# Development
I (Cale) work on my D:\Workspace drive on an SSD and I like it very much. We need to map to Mac, so the folders in the VS project need to get mapped to relative folders as opposed to absolute paths.
