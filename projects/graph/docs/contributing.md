# Kabuki Graph

## Contributing

We are currently in need of help porting the [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) from SDL/OpenGLES2 to Kabuki Tek/ANGLE/OpenGLES. Our keyboard driver is just better and we're vastly more modular. Nuklear already has some code in it for drawing curves so we need to recreate the [cvPlot](https://github.com/leonardvandriel/cvplot) library using Nuklear.

Once we have the graphing calculator up and running then we can focus on the Interactive Generative Evolutionary Environment for KabukiNet (IGEEK) and the Autopilot. IGEEK is dependant on the Autopilot so the Autopilot has to also be an Graph plugin.
