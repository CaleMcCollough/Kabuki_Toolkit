Welcome to the Cell Evolutionary Interface wiki!. The Cell Evolutionary Interface is an experimental Interactive Evolutionary Computational (IEC) application of biomimicry in computer science. It is abstract simulation of the human body immune system on the cellular level with quasi-robotic white blood cells that fight off genetically modified retroviruses. The goal of the simulation is for either the viruses to kill the host, the host to kill the viruses, or for the two to maintain a symbiotic relationship.
