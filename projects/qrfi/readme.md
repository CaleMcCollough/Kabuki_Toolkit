# QR-Fi - Secure Wireless Internet Through a Wired or Cellular ConnectionQR-Fi is a seed stage project started 10/16/2017 as a method to secure the passing of DTL/SSL keys using a secure wired or cellular connection. The ideap is simple, your WiFi is not safe to pass of login certificates over but once you're logged in you have a secure encryption key and you're safe to use public wifi. You just have to, use a webcam and QR Codes to create a very slow network connection, in the several KB/sec, and use this to login, to say Facebook or email, then you close the connection and you are now free to login to whatever website you wish on PUBLIC WIFI!!!# Quick Links* [Kabuki Toolkit](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit) - Software and Firmware SDK used.* [List of RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RFCs) - Read the ones you have questions about.## DevelopmentIf you're interested in contributing to the project, please join the [Kabuki Toolkit Development Team](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit).
