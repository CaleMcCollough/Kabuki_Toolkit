# seams

This folder contains the kabuki.Toolkit. Each Layer {Milli, Micro, Nano, Pico, Femto } Seam has it's own project here in the toolkit. The way to read the seam indexes is that Layer 0 is always the SDK. Kabuki Toolkit has the Milli Layers:

| Layer |     Name      | Description |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:------------|

|  0_2  |    Auditory   | Music, audio, and sound. |
|  0_3  |    Visual     | All things visible to or by the computer. |
