# Kabuki Theater
A modern C++11 software development kit and app framework built on top of [Simple Fast Media Layer](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) and the [Chinese Room](https://github.com/Kabuki-Toolkit/ChineseRoom).

## Quick Links
* [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/Kabuki-Toolkit/Kabuki-Theater/wiki/Quickstart-Guide.md) -
    Check here for the Kabuki Theater wiki and github repository!
* [Kabuki Toolkit Website](https://kabuki-toolkit.github.io/) - Official Kabuki Toolkit website. We are currently
    looking for someone to help us fix the CSS on the website. It only works right at < 1024 pixel width so the
    problem is in the @media section.

## Project Organization
Each module listed below is decoupled, but all share a common header-only core
of the Chinese Room. This microcore is the _ namespace. For examples, please 
see the Examples folder.
