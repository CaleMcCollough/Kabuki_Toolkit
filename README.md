# Kabuki Software Development Kit
Kabuki SDK is a modern crossâ€“platform C++ SDK for creating mobile/PC apps, connected devices, 
remote controller, musical instruments, and more with FreeI2P, Kabuki SDK is headless, meaning 
that it is designed to work with native UI widgets to integrate with Xamarin, .NET, Visual Studio 
2015, Qt, Eclipse, XCode, and most C++ APIs.

## Why use Kabuki SDK?

Kabuki SDK is built on FreeI2P, which is good for working with dictionaries (@google Python Dictionary), inter-process communication, serializing data, remotely controlling apps and IoT devices, and debugging apps. FreeI2P is the link between you app, and the world. Kabuki SDK builds ontop of FreeI2P to provide tools for working with multiple users, social networking, searching for metadata, DLL-safe data structures, and abstract user interfaces for working with multi-headed SDKs like Xamarin, JUCE, wxWidgets, etc.
