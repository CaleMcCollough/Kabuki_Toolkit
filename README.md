Kabuki Toolkit (KT) is a cross-platform `Modern C++` Firmware-to-Software Development Kit (F2SDK) for making intelligent connected technologies with *Script* and the *Kabuki VM*. KT is built on top of some of the  best commercial-friendly open-source `C/C++` with `Modern-C++` formatted with the [`Google C++ Style Guide`](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). **#WorkInProgress** **#CodeSloth**

## `Modern C++`

`Modern C++` isn't just a buzz-word, it's a way of life. `Modern C++` means many things, but arguably most importantly that:

1.  A detailed best practice style guide and coding conventions are used. **✓**
2.  The code uses C++1x language features **where appropriate**. **✓**
3.  The code performs as much functionality at compile time as possible. **✓**
4.  The code uses a standardized set of general purpose data structures such as std or crabs. **✓**
6.  Code repositories use Issue Driven Development or competing best practice in order to remain agile and the master branch always passes an automated unit test script. **/**
7.  The code uses *Stack Programming* techniques to minimizes the use of dynamic memory by keeping as much data as possible in the CPU registers and on the hardware-assisted stack. **✓**
8.  Smart pointers are used when dynamic memory is required unless performance is critical. **✓**
10. Primary SDK is programed with cross-platform with cross-language bindings. **/**
11. API documents are automatically generated using metadata tags such as Doxygen. **✓**
12. Code uses structured programming with the exception of performance critical applications. **✓**
13. Libraries may integrate `Antiquated-C++`, meaning `C++` code that is not modern, but `Antiquated-C++` is wrapped with `Modern-C++ Adapters` and are segregated from the `Modern-C++` code and marked. **/**

## Script

Searle's Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification (Script) defines a software-defined networking protocol (SDNP) and embedded-friendly family of languages that facilitates artificial intelligence using functional programming and natural language processing (NLP) ala the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (Crabs) (**#WorkInProgress**). The Script SDNP has the unique ability to allow multiple programming languages simultaneously, but there is only one reference implementation: **Automata Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Script**. ASCII Script is best described as a mix of JavaScript with Lua and LISP. ASCII Script supports all of the C++ data types along with native dictionaries and maps that use contiguous memory and an asynchronous round-robin scheduler for **BLAZING** fast performance and with minimum overhead. ASCII Script allows for procedural programming to be mixed with LISP-style expressions using a simple set of powerful rules for on-pass parsing symbols as fast as possible and handling unexpected tokens.

### The Chinese Room

The [Chinese Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) is a famous artificial intelligence philosophy thought experiment invented by the American philosopher John Searle; it is a great place to start learning some philosophy and is a subject usually discussed in most introductory AI classes. The experiment highlights the difference between strong vs weak AI and how a normal everyday room in an office or network of rooms can form to create a turning equivalent machine that can fluently speak any language. Script utilizes philosophy mimicry in order to mimic the Chinese Room as much as is helpful, functional, and sane to produce some delightfully geeky, clean, fast, and classy code.

## Kabuki Theater

Kabuki Toolkit is named after a famous artificial intelligence theory of consciousness called the Kabuki Theater Model of Consciousness. The Kabuki Theater concept is that our lucid consciousness is like viewing a Kabuki Theater in person; each actor on stage close up looks rather simple and imperfect, but when you put all of the actors and props on stage and place the viewer in a dark stage with stage lights focused on tiny portions of the stage in a controlled manner, it creates a Gestalt perception of consciousness where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. On stage there are so many interesting things to look at that are far enough away you can't see their real-life imperfections, and it creates an illusion of lucid consciousness from your mind bouncing around all of the trippy stage props resulting in a saturation of the mind's short-term memory that tricks the mind into thinking it is a fluid experience.
