﻿﻿﻿﻿# Kabuki Toolkit

Kabuki Toolkit (KT) is a modern cross-platform C++1x software and firmware toolkit for making intelligent connected technologies with Script and the Kabuki VM. KT is built on top of some of the  best commercial-friendly open-source C and C++ libraries formatted using the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). #WorkInProgress

## Searle's Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification (Script)

Script is a software-defined networking protocol and embedded-friendly family of languages that facilitates artificial intelligence and machine learning (AIML) using functional programming and natural language processing (NLP). Script is best described as a mix of JavaScript, Python, Lua, and LISP. JavaScript because it's asynchronous with a round-robin scheduler, Python because it has native dictionaries, Lua because of Script's RPC nature, and Script has a rather unique f of LISP called Interprocess LISP.
