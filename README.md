# Kabuki Theater
A modern C++11 software development kit and app framework built on top of [Simple Free Media Layer](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Why use Kabuki Theater?

Kabuki Theater is built on the Chinese Room, which is good for working with dictionaries (@google Python Dictionary), interprocess communication, serializing data, remotely controlling apps and IoT devices, and debugging apps. The Chinese Room is the link between your app or embedded device, and the world.
