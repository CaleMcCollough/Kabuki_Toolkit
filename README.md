# Kabuki Toolkit
A modern full-stack embedded C\++11 software and firmware platform built on top of mix of some of the world's best Apache 2.0 License compatible C/C++ APIs integrated into a ubiquitous style formatted using the [Google C++ Style Sheet](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). #WorkInProgress

## Mission Statement
Kabuki Toolkit's mission is to provide a clean SDK with good example projects, Doxygen API documentation, and tools for making portable apps and DLL plugins; and to automate the library build system and process of integrating, refactoring, and cleaning up the 3rd party libraries into a modern common style.

## Seeking Developers
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/kabuki-toolkit/kabuki_toolkit/wiki) for instructions on how you can get involved. What you are seeing in the repo is a  prototype for the perfect C/C++/C#/Python/etc library format with a shared C core and multi-language bindings. What we need to do is repeat the way I set the SDK up, not my non-functional code. All I care about is the Sloth utility. Please notice that the git repo size is getting HUGE!!! We gotta dump the development crap and just leave the golden dev nuggets they want with a Sloth script. Slot is based on the SCRIPT, and I'm still mapping RPC funcitons. #CodeSloth

    Check here for the Kabuki Toolkit Wiki and GitHub repository!
* [Kabuki Toolkit Website](https://kabuki-toolkit.github.io/) - Official Kabuki Toolkit website. We are currently looking for someone to help us fix the CSS on the website. It only works right at < 1024 pixel width so the problem is in the @media section.
