# Kabuki Software Development Kit
Kabuki SDK is an early-stage C++ SDK and graphics engine built on top of [Simple Free Media Layer](http://www.sfml-dev.org/). At this point it doesn't really do much.

## Why use Kabuki SDK?

Kabuki SDK is built on FreeI2P, which is good for working with dictionaries (@google Python Dictionary), inter-process communication, serializing data, remotely controlling apps and IoT devices, and debugging apps. FreeI2P is the link between you app, and the world.
