# Kabuki Toolkit
An cross-platform cross-language toolkit to for creating the Sloth and
Chinese Rooms. Kabuki Toolkit is an Abstract Algebra Automata; a Turing 
Machine and functional programming environment.

## Seeking Developers
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/kabuki-toolkit/kabuki_toolkit/wiki) 
for instructions on how you can get involved. What you are seeing in the repo 
is a  prototype for the perfect C/C++/C#/Python/etc library format with a 
shared C core and multi-language bindings. What we need to do is repeat the 
way I set the SDK up, not my non-functional code. All I care about is the 
Sloth utility. Please notice that the git repo size is getting HUGE!!! We 
gotta dump the development crap and just leave the golden dev nuggets they 
want with a Sloth script. Slot is based on the SCRIPT, and I'm still mapping 
RPC functions. #CodeSloth

* [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/Kabuki-Toolkit/Kabuki_Toolkit/wiki/Quickstart-Guide.md) -
    Check here for the Kabuki Toolkit Wiki and GitHub repository!
* [Kabuki Toolkit Website](https://kabuki-toolkit.github.io/) - Official Kabuki Toolkit website. We are currently looking for someone to help us fix the CSS on the website. It only works right at < 1024 pixel width so the problem is in the @media section.
