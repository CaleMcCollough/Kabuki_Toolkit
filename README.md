﻿﻿﻿﻿# Kabuki ToolkitKabuki Toolkit (KT) is an Apache 2.0 Licensed cross-platform software and firmware toolkit with Embedded-C++1x core for making just about anything. KT contains a compliant Script Protocol implementation built on top of some of the best commercial friendly open-source libraries available on the internet all formatted using the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
## ScriptSearle's Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry Protocol, (Script) is an object-oriented software-defined networking protocol for creating ad-hoc self-evolving IoT networks. It can be described as a byte encoded version of [Open Sound Control (OSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control)with compression that can handle a lot more messages. Using Script developerscan easily create higher-level ad-hoc network APIs using a cross-languageembedded-friendly abstract object stack with virtually unlimited functionparameters and lambda function return results that may change at runtime.## Quick Links* [FAQ - ](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki-toolkit/blob/master/docs/faq.md)   *- Check here for the Kabuki Toolkit Wiki and GitHub repository!** [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki-toolkit/blob/master/docs/quickstart-guide.md)  - *Check here for the Kabuki Toolkit Wiki and GitHub repository!** [Kabuki Starship Website](https://kabuki-starship.github.io/)  - *Official Kabuki Toolkit website.
