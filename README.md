Kabuki Toolkit is an Abstract Algebra Automata; a Turing Machine and functional programming environment.## Quick Links* [FAQ](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/tree/master/docs/faq) - Check here for the Kabuki Toolkit Wiki and GitHub repository!* [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/tree/master/docs/quickstart-guide) - Check here for the Kabuki Toolkit Wiki and GitHub repository!* [Kabuki Project Website](https://kabuki-project.github.io/) - Official Kabuki Toolkit website. We are currently looking for someone to help us fix the CSS on the website. It only works right at < 1024 pixel width so the problem is in the @media section.* [Script Specification RFC Draft](https://github.com/kabuki-project/kabuki-toolkit/wiki/Script-Specification-RFC) - Release for Comment for Searle's Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry  Protocol (Script).## ScriptKabuki Toolkit is powered by Searle's Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry  Protocol (Script). Script is a TCP, HTTP, Bittorrent, DNS, You Name It Protocol Killer that combines all communication protocols into *harmonious* *mathematically perfect* **Group Automata** with inherent **natural language processing** and *Interstellar Class* **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. *#WorkInProgress*## Seeking DevelopersThe dirty secret about open source projects is most people aren't useful for a few years till they figure out the *whats*, *where*s, *whens*, and *hows* (**3WH**). You can sign up as a Non-committed Contributor and just ask some obvious questions and that would actually be more helpful than you think. We are seeking international developers, particularly from China, to help with Unicode support as this is the *World Famous* **Chinese Room** and I am not Chinese. Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/kabuki-toolkit/kabuki_toolkit/wiki) for instructions on how you can get involved.## SDK Modules| Name         | Description  ||:------------:|:-------------|| chinese_room | Chinese Room Automata.|| al           | Audio Library.|| app          | Application framework.|| biz          | Business and eCommerce.|| code         | Coding utilities.|| data         | Data and data logging.|| gl           | Graphics Library.|| gui          | Graphical user interfaces.|| hmi          | Human-machine Interfaces.|| json         | JSON.|| id           | Identification.|| math         | Math.|| midi         | MIDI.|| tek          | Firmware toolkit.|| pplx         | Parallel Patterns Library.|| pro          | Projects, tasks, and scheduling.|| process      | Threads and interprocess IO.|| serial       | Serial IO.|| utils        | Utilities.|| video        | Video.|| web          | WWW and IoT.|## 3rd Party APIs* [Microsoft REST SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk)* [boost::interprocess](http://www.boost.org/)* [boost::polygon](http://www.boost.org/)* [boost::dll](http://www.boost.org/)* [boost::pool](http://www.boost.org/)* [boost::tokenizer](http://www.boost.org/)* [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle)* [nanovg](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg)* [nanogui](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui)* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)* [Maximilian](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian)* [Static Math](https://github.com/Morwenn/static_math)* [mbed](https://www.mbed.com/en/)* [OpenAL-Soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft)* [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)* [RtMIDI](https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi)* [AStyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/)* [Serial](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial)* [SFML (Replacing with SDL)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)* [gflw (Replacing with SDL)](http://www.glfw.org/)## LicenseCopyright 2017 (C) [Cale McCollough](mailto:calemccollough@gmail.com) and contributors.
