# F2 Foundational Framework Benchmark

This software benchmarks the F2 Foundational Framework Nanoframework, or F2 Nanoframework or F2 for short. 

Benchmarks include:

* Integer-to-String algorithms.
* Pointer alignment algorithms.
* Floating-point-to-string algorithms.
* Mixed floating-point and integer print-and-scan.

# __0_0_0__01_Socket

In order to print floating-point numbers we need to first test the memory copy and alignment algorithms.
